# Selenium Testing
This application was our final assignment for quality assurance and it uses Selenium. 
As part of the assignment, search terms where saved in local storage and then could be output to the "search" page by clicking the "search" link. 
Essentially this application runs automated tests for valid user inputs on a webpage built with basic HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
